# DISCLAIMER
I want to stress on three main points:
* This was my first Flutter project so I have not used any best practices and it needs a lot of code refactoring.
* DO NOT USE real emails during sign up
* DO NOT USE real location when testing. They are NOT encrypted and the database is open to public!

All the setup is already done. I am using the free credit I got for the google account so you don't have to do anything until it runs out.
